# ⚡ AMP-Optimized-BOD

## 🤝 Welcome
- Welcome to the AMP-Optimized-BOD repository! This collection of Alteryx macros is designed to optimize and streamline workflows by leveraging the AMP (Alteryx Multi-Processing) engine while targeting Block Until Done (BOD) processes.

## 🧰 Included Macros
- 📥 Input Group
- 📤 Output Group

### 📥 Input Group (Standard Macro)

#### 📝 Description:
- Input Group is an Alteryx Standard Macro designed to assign a selected group, modifying both the data and metadata within the stream.

### 📤 Output Group (Standard Macro)

#### 📝 Description:
- Output Group is an Alteryx Standard Macro that filters a selected group from a data stream containing multiple groups.

**Together, these macros complement each other in workflow design:**
- 📌 Input Group assigns and labels groups (data + metadata).

🎯 Output Group filters the chosen group, enabling controlled data flow across complex streams.

🔀 Workflow Synergy

The synergy between these macros is key to effective workflow orchestration.

By using:

🏷️ Input Group to designate groups,

🔗 operations such as Union and classic Block Until Done (BOD),

The workflow ensures the correct execution order.

When multiple groups are created and segmented using BOD, the Output Group becomes essential:

🧹 Filtering specific data streams

🧭 Maintaining precise output sequencing—even with parallel AMP processing

🚀 Getting Started

Explore the macros in this repository to harness the power of AMP optimization in Alteryx workflows.

Use Input Group and Output Group to:

🏷️ Assign groups

🔍 Filter data streams

⚙️ Control execution order

Resulting in faster, cleaner, and more predictable workflows.

🤝 Contributions and Collaboration

Contributions, suggestions, and enhancements from the community are welcome!

💡 Let’s collaborate to expand and refine these macros for optimized AMP-based Alteryx workflows.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to improve the repository.

ℹ️ Note:
This README provides a high-level overview. Refer to individual macro documentation for detailed usage instructions.
